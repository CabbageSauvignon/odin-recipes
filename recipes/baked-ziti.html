        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This baked ziti recipe is a real hit amongst my fiance and I due to it being absolutely delicious. It's unique in the fact that the pasta is not boiled prior to baking, rather it is soaked, and the pasta is fully cooked during the baking process.</p>
        <p>The key to a successful ziti bake is starting with a good sauce. This can be homemade or store bought, but it must be delicious, either way. Go figure.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Ziti</li>
            <li>6 cups red sauce</li>
            <li>12 oz whole-milk ricotta</li>
            <li>3 oz Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>3 tbsp minced fresh parsely</li>
            <li>3 tbsp minced fresh basil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li> 
            <li>1 lb whole milk mozzarella</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Place the ziti in a large bowl and cover with hot salted water by 3 or 4 inches. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, stirring it after the first 5 minutes to prevent sticking. Drain.</li>
            <li>Pour half of the marinara into a large pot, add the ricotta, half of the Par- migiano, the eggs, the cream, and half of the parsley and basil, and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add the soaked ziti along with half of the cheese cubes and stir until well combined. Transfer to a 13- by 9-inch baking dish and top with the remaining marinara sauce and mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until the cheese is beginning to brown, about 15 minutes longer. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the remaining Parmigiano, then let cool for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley and basil and serve.</li>
        </ol>
