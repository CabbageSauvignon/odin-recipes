        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This baked ziti recipe is a real hit amongst my fiance and I due to it being absolutely delicious. It's unique in the fact that the pasta is not boiled prior to baking, rather it is soaked, and the pasta is fully cooked during the baking process.</p>
        <p>The key to a successful ziti bake is starting with a good sauce. This can be homemade or store bought, but it must be delicious, either way. Go figure.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb Ziti</li>
            <li>6 cups red sauce</li>
